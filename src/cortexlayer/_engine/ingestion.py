"""Ingestion: chunk raw text into small pages, extract entities, embed, insert.

Pages are deliberately small — roughly one fact/statement each — because
link-expansion works best on focused pages. Chunking: split on line breaks,
then greedily pack sentences so no page exceeds ``MAX_PAGE_CHARS``. Entity
extraction is delegated to an :class:`~cortexlayer._engine.nlp.NLP` object.

Ingestion never runs the linking pass — linking stays a batch operation.
